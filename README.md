## Epic Fail Inc's Github Game-Off Submission


##### Intro
Greetings!  
My name is Shane and I am one of the creators of Epic Fail Inc, a website that was created for our entry to this competition.  
  
We decided to create "Boom" as our first ever public Unity game for the Github Game-off because we felt like it would give us the incentive
and motivation required to actually start and finish a game. Unfortunately, however, this game was a victim of procrastination.  
  
##### Description
Boom is a side-scrolling puzzle game that involves strategically placing bombs in order to destroy or move obstacles that block you from reaching
your objective.  
  

Controls:  
-Left/Right arrow keys or 'A'/'D' key: move left and right  
-'Q': Drop bomb
